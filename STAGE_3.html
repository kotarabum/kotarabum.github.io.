        <div class="text"> Stage 3 “Metamorphose of Rye Lane" represents site re
            search and activating site elements for advertising local culture and vibes. Peckham attracts 
            lots of people by the rooftops and variety of 
            food and take away, however gentrification of the street declined few small businesses that 
            locals used to meet with each other. Residents create conversation on the street, unfortunately, there is no space for exchange of ideas and 
            celebration affordable for every visitor. Renovation will include circular economy system, 
            recycling local elements such as scaffold and wood, landscape garden on the top of retails 
            and sum up it into “roller coaster” adventures pavilion for kids and parents and young adults. </div>
